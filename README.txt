Scrabble is a classic word-building board game where players score points by creating words from individual letter tiles. Each tile has a specific point value, and the game board contains special bonus squares that can multiply letter or word scores. Players take turns placing words on the board in a crossword-style layout, connecting to existing tiles already in play.

The objective is to accumulate the highest score by strategically forming high-value words, using premium board spaces, and managing your letter rack effectively. Scrabble challenges your vocabulary, spelling skills, and tactical thinking, making every game both competitive and intellectually engaging.
